                <h3>Mother</h3>
                    <p>My mother is the strongest person I know, and if there is anything that can attest to the strength of a woman and mother, it is the untimely loss of her child.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Natia & Phil</li>
                    <p>Natia & Phil are a couple of my longest and closest friends.</p>
                <li>Karl & Aubrey</li>
                    <p>Karl and Aubrey are some of the most important people in my life. Both of them have helped me out with quite a lot in life, one of which is the sudden death of one of my twin brothers several years ago.</p>
                <li>Benita (KJ's Mom)</li>
                    <p>Benita was such a strong woman, somoene that I never thought anything would ever get under her skin. That is why the her sudden death at her own hands has been such a shoke to us all. She was the main person who had my back and reminded me not to allow other people to get under my skin.</p>
                <li>Matt & Christina</li>
                    <p>Both Matt and Christina are friends of mine who are together, and I work with both of them. Right now Matt and I work in the same department at Charles River Labratories </p>
                <li>Isabella</li>
                    <p>Isabella isn't a friend that I have had for a long time, but she is someone that has grown dear to me. She has helped me with a terrible relationship with another friend of ours. Someone who blamed me for everything within our friendship. She is someone that is currently my roommate and I'm lucky to have met her and to call her my friend.</p>
                <li>Melissa</li>
                    <p>Melissa isn't my closest friend just yet, but she is someone who is on her way to be. She is someone who has gone through a lot just as I have. Our shared experiences is what is helping us be closer everyday. It also helps that I work with her as well.</p>
                <li>Lindsay Wilson</li>
                    <p>Lindsay was one of my best teachers that I have ever had. He was there for me after my brother died. He is such an inspirational person, and as the editor of The Meadow, he asked me for one of my poems to publish, which I was honored to do.</p>
                <li>Everyone in my WGU class</li>
                    <p>I am happy and lucky to have the people in this class as my classmates. All of the students are the nicest people and they are pretty amazing and smart. They are picking up this web development class so quickly, it's pretty impressive.</p>
